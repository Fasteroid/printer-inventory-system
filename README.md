# College Projects: The Printer Inventory System

### Context
This was a semester-long project engineered as part of CSC214 at Delaware Technical Community College.

The Printer Inventory System is a hypothetical inventory management system designed for medium-to-small sized organizations. &nbsp;As the name implies, it manages a list of printers—but could be easily reworked to manage something else due to our object-oriented approach.<br>
Normally, this project is written in Java and has no networking capabilities, instead serving as a simple front-end to a locally stored database. That's boring though, and also borderline useless. &nbsp;Why design a system like this if you could only access it from one place?

We dreamed up a web app instead so that the hypothetical printer database could be accessed from any location of a hypothetical campus.<br>
And it worked. &nbsp;We could. &nbsp;Take that, past semester classes!

### Important
Security was not implemented for this project during development both because of time constraints and because it was not a requirement.<br> As such, it should <b>never be used in production</b>—no exceptions!

If you're actually interested in using a variant of this system, contact a real software developer. &nbsp;This was a hypothetical system designed only to showcase how a similar real-world counterpart might function.
